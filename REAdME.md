# wordpress_smci

I created the requested table in mySQL with the following query:

```mysql
    CREATE TABLE contact_form_backup (
        first_name VARCHAR(255),
        last_name VARCHAR(255),
        email VARCHAR(255),
        date_submitted DATE
    )
```

I used the twentyseventeen theme.

`functions.php` is located at:
`wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/functions.php`

Lines 617-642 show the function I created.

Please email me if you have questions.
